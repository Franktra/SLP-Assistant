💬 Speech-Language Pathology Home Practice 💬
💡 Introduction
The purpose of this project is to empower parents and caregivers with practical tools and strategies to reinforce the skills learned in Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) sessions at home. By weaving these strategies into their regular routines, families can provide their children with opportunities for growth and skill reinforcement in a fun and engaging way.

🎯 Why is this important?
This resource is designed to help:

Reinforce the skills learned during SLP sessions
Provide engaging and practical activities
Support children's communication development within the context of daily routines and activities
Strengthen parent-child and caregiver-child relationships
Build confidence and rapport in communication abilities
📖 How to Use this Resource
This project contains a python program, SLP_home_practice.py. After you download the program, you can run it in your Python environment by typing python SLP_home_practice.py in your terminal.

You will then be prompted to input data about your child's interests, preferences, goals, typical home routine, and activities. The program will generate a customized list of activities and strategies you can use at home based on this data.
